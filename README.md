This is a two player variant of the Egyptian Rat Screw card game.

Each player is dealt 26 cards.

Players alternately discard one card from their hand.

When some of the following combinations occur players race to slap the discard pile:
 * Double (e.g. 2-2)
 * Marriage (e.g. K-Q)
 * Sandwich (e.g. 2-5-2)
 * Divorce (e.g. Q-10-K)
 * Three in a Row (e.g. K-1-2, 3-4-5)

The player who slaps first takes all the cards from the pile.

If someone slaps when there is no valid combination, the other player takes all the cards.

The goal of the game is to have all 52 cards in your hand.
